# GifTastic/ AJAX calls

Overview

Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs. To complete this, call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.


Create an array of strings related to the same topic and save it to a variable called topics. The app will take the topics in this array and create buttons in the HTML. Use a loop that appends a button for each string in the array. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
